<P>In the normal flow of a programme, when the Java Virtual Machine is running 
  your code, one method after another will be executed, starting with the main 
  method. When a method has its turn at the head of the programming queue it said 
  be on top of the <b>stack</b>. After the whole of the method has been executed, 
  it is taken off the stack to be replaced by the next method in the queue. To 
  illustrate the principal, change <a href="java_error_handling.html">your programme 
  code</a> to this:</P>
<p align="center"><img src="images/errors/stack_methods_A.gif" width="370" height="327" border="1" alt="Sample Java code examining the stack"></p>
<p>We now have a Main method and two others: a method called <b>m1</b>, and a 
  method called <b>m2</b>. When the programme first starts, the Main method is 
  on top of the stack. However, inside of the Main method we have a call to the 
  m1 method. When this method is called it jumps to the top of the stack. The 
  m1 method in turn calls the m2 method. When m2 is called, it jumps to the top 
  of the stack, pushing m1 aside temporarily. After m2 finishes, control is given 
  back to m1. When m1 is finished, it gets pushed off the top of the stack, and 
  control is handed back to the Main method.</p>
<p>Run your programme and watch the Output window to see what gets printed out:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/errors/stack_methods_output.gif" width="170" height="80" border="1" alt="Programme output"></p>
<p>If something goes wrong in method m2, the JVM will look for any error handling, 
  like a <b>try &#133; catch</b> block. If there is no error handling, the Exception 
  will get handed to m1 to see if it is dealing with the error. We don't have 
  any error handling in m1 so again the Exception gets passed up the stack, this 
  time to the Main method. If the Main method doesn't deal with the Exception 
  then you'll get a strange error message printed to the Output window. As an 
  example, adapt your <b>m2</b> method to this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>static void m2( ) {</b></p>
<p> <b><span class="TextIndent3">int x = 10;</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">int y = 0;</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">double z = x / y;</span></b></p>
<p> <b><span class="TextIndent3">System.out.println( z );</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">System.out.println(&quot;Method Two - m2&quot;);</span></b></p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>}</b></p>
<p>The method contains the divide by zero error again. Your code should now look 
  like ours below:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/errors/stack_methods_C.gif" width="371" height="402" border="1" alt=" A divide by zero error in Java"></p>
<p>Run the programme and watch what happens in the Output window:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/errors/stack_trace_output.gif" width="481" height="120" border="1" alt="A Java exception message"></p>
<p>What you're looking at is something called a stack trace. The three lines in 
  blue underline refer to your methods, and where they can be found: </p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>package_name.class_name.method_name</b></p>
<p>The one at the top is where the error first occurred, in <b>m2</b>. Java was 
  looking for this to be handled by an <b>ArithmeticException</b>, which is where 
  divide by zero errors should be caught. There was no error handling in m2, m1, 
  or main. So the programme outputted to the default error handler.</p>
<p>Change you m1 method to this:</p>
<p> <span class="TextIndent2"><b>try {</b></span><b><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">System.out.println(&quot;Method One - m1&quot;);</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">m2( );</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent2">}</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent2">catch (ArithmeticException err) {</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">System.out.println( err.getMessage( ) );</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent2">}</span></b></p>
<p>We've now wrapped up the method called m2 in a <b>try</b> block. In the <b>catch</b> 
  part, we've used the Exception type that was reported in the stack trace - ArithmeticException.</p>
<p>Run the code again, and the Output window will display the following:<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/errors/stack_trace_output2.gif" width="164" height="73" border="1" alt="Java has handled the error"></p>
<p>Notice that the error message is printed out: &quot;/ by zero&quot;. The whole 
  of the m2 method was not executed, but was stopped where the error occurred. 
  Control was then passed back to m1. Because there was a catch block to handle 
  the error, the JVM saw no need to a default error handler, but printed out the 
  message between the curly brackets of catch.</p>
<p>The programme itself was not stopped, however. Control was passed back to the 
  Main method, where the m1 method was called. The final line in the Main method, 
  printing out &quot;End Main method&quot;, was executed. This has important implications. 
  Suppose you needed the value from m1, because you were going to do something 
  with it in Main. The value wouldn't be there, and your programme may not behave 
  as expected.</p>
<p>But if you see a stack trace in the Output window, just remember that first 
  line is where the problem occurred; the rest of the lines, if any, are where 
  the Exception was handed up the stack, usually finishing at the main method.</p>
<p>In the next part, we'll look at Logic Errors.</p>
