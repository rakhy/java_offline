<p>Now that you have connected to the database, the next step is to access the 
  table in your database. For this, you need to execute a SQL Statement, and then 
  manipulate all the rows and columns that were returned.</p>
<p>To execute a SQL statement on your table, you set up a Statement object. So 
  add this import line to the top of your code:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>import java.sql.Statement;</b></p>
<p>In the <b>try</b> part of the <b>try &#133; catch</b> block add the following 
  line (add it just below your Connection line):</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>Statement stmt = con.createStatement( );</b></p>
<p>Here, we're creating a Statement object called <b>stmt</b>. The Statement object 
  needs a Connection object, with the <b>createStatment</b> method. </p>
<p>We also need a SQL Statement for the Statement object to execute. So add this 
  line to your code:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>String SQL = &quot;SELECT * FROM Workers&quot;;</b></p>
<p>The above statement selects all the records from the database table called 
  <b>Workers</b>.</p>
<p>We can pass this SQL query to a method of the Statement object called <b>executeQuery</b>. 
  The Statement object will then go to work gathering all the records that match 
  our query.</p>
<p>However, the <b>executeQuery</b> method returns all the records in something 
  called a <b>ResultSet</b>. Before we explain what these are, add the following 
  import line to the top of your code:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>import java.sql.ResultSet;</b></p>
<p>Now add this line just below your SQL String line:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery( SQL );</b></p>
<p>So our ResultSet object is called <b>rs</b>. This will hold all the records 
  from the database table. Before we go any further, though, here's an explanation 
  of what ResultSets are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>ResultSets in Java</h3>
<p>A ResultSet is a way to store and manipulate the records returned from a SQL 
  query. ResultSets come in three different types. The type you use depends on 
  what you want to do with the data: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Do you just want to move forward through the records, from beginning to 
    end?</li>
  <li>Do you want to move forward AND backward through the records, as well as 
    detecting any changes made to the records? <br>
    3) Do you want to move forward AND backward through the records, but are not 
    bothered about any changes made to the records?</li>
  <li>Do you want to move forward AND backward through the records, but are not 
    bothered about any changes made to the records?</li>
</ol>
<p>Type number 1 on the list above is called a TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY ResultSet. Number 
  2 on the list is a TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE ResultSet. The third ResultSet option 
  is called TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE. </p>
<p>The ResultSet type goes between the round brackets of createStement:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>Statement stmt = con.createStatement( );</b></p>
<p>Because we've left the round brackets empty, we'll get the default RecordSet, 
  which is TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY. In the next section, we'll use one of the other 
  types. But you use them like this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><font size="2"><b>Statement stmt = con.createStatement( 
  RecordSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE );</b></font></p>
<p>So you first type the word RecordSet. After a dot, you add the RecordSet type 
  you want to use.</p>
<p>However, it doesn't end there. If you want to use TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE or 
  TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE you also need to specify whether the ResultSet is Read 
  Only or whether it is Updatable. You do this with two built-in constants: CONCUR_READ_ONLY 
  and CONCUR_UPDATABLE. Again, these come after the word RecordSet:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2">ResultSet.<b>CONCUR_READ_ONLY</b><br>
  ResultSet.<b>CONCUR_UPDATABLE</b></p>
<p>This leads to a rather long line of code:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><font size="2"><b>Statement stmt = con.createStatement( 
  RecordSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE, ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE);</b></font></p>
<p>One more thing to get used to with ResultSets is something called a <b>Cursor</b>. 
  A Cursor is really just a pointer to a table row. When you first load the records 
  into a ResultSet, the Cursor is pointing to just before the first row in the 
  table. You then use methods to manipulate the Cursor. But the idea is to identify 
  a particular row in your table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Using a ResultSet</h3>
<p>Once you have all the records in a Results set, there are methods you can use 
  to manipulate your records. Here are the methods you'll use most often:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/databases/resultset_options.gif" width="459" height="300" alt="ResultSet options"></p>
<p>The ResultSet also has methods you can use to identify a particular column 
  (field) in a row. You can do so either by using the name of the column, or by 
  using its index number. For our Workers table we set up four columns. They had 
  the following names: ID, First_Name, Last_Name, and Job_Title. The index numbers 
  are therefore 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
<p>We set up the ID column to hold Integer values. The method you use to get at 
  integer values in a column is getInt:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>int id_col = rs.getInt(&quot;ID&quot;);</b></p>
<p>Here, we've set up an integer variable called <b>id_col</b>. We then use the 
  <b>getInt</b> method of our ResultSet object, which is called <b>rs</b>. In 
  between the round brackets, we have the name of the column. We could use the 
  Index number instead:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>int id_col = rs.getInt(1);</b></p>
<p>Notice that the Index number doesn't have quote marks, but the name does.</p>
<p>For the other three columns in our database table, we set them up to hold Strings. 
  We, therefore, need the getString method:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>String first_name = rs.getString(&quot;First_Name&quot;);</b></p>
<p>Or we could use the Index number:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>String first_name = rs.getString(2);</b></p>
<p>Because the ResultSet Cursor is pointing to just before the first record when 
  the data is loaded, we need to use the next method to move to the first row. 
  The following code will get the first record from the table:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>rs.next( );<br>
  int id_col = rs.getInt(&quot;ID&quot;);<br>
  String first_name = rs.getString(&quot;First_Name&quot;);<br>
  String last_name = rs.getString(&quot;Last_Name&quot;);<br>
  String job = rs.getString(&quot;Job_Title&quot;);</b></p>
<p>Notice that <b>rs.next</b> comes first in this code. This will move the Cursor 
  to the first record in the table.</p>
<p>You can add a print line to your code to display the record in the Output window:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>System.out.println( id_col + &quot; &quot; + first_name 
  + &quot; &quot; + last_name + &quot; &quot; + job );</b></p>
<p>Here's what your code should look like now (we've adapted the print line because 
  it's a bit too long):</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/databases/code_record1.gif" width="505" height="365" border="1" alt="Java code to connect to a database table"></p>
<p>If you want to go through all the records in the table, you can use a loop. 
  Because the next method returns true or false, you can use it as the condition 
  for a while loop:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>while ( rs.next( ) ) {</b></p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>}</b></p>
<p>In between the round brackets of <b>while</b> we have <b>rs.next</b>. This 
  will be true as long as the Cursor hasn't gone past the last record in the table. 
  If it has, rs.next will return a value of false, and the while loop will end. 
  Using rs.next like this will also move the Cursor along one record at a time. 
  Here's the same code as above, but using a while loop instead. Change your code 
  to match:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/databases/code_record_loop.gif" width="511" height="412" border="1" alt="Loping through all the records in the ResultSet"></p>
<p>When you run the above code, the Output window should display the following:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/databases/code_record_loop_output.gif" width="290" height="103" alt="The output of the Java code" border="1"></p>
<p>Now that you have an idea of how to connect to a database table and display 
  records we'll move on and write a more complex programme using forms and buttons 
  to scroll through the records.</p>
