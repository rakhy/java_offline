<P>You can pass more than one value over to your methods. Add the following method 
  to <a href="java_method_parameters.html">your MyMethods class</a>:</P>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/New_Class_print.gif" width="373" height="104" border="1" alt="A Java method with two parameters"></p>
<p>All this method does is to print something out. Between the round brackets 
  of the method name we have two values, a String variable called aString and 
  an int variable called aVal. When we call this method, we need a string first 
  and then a number. Try to do it the other way round and you'll get error messages.</p>
<p>Go back to your TestMethods class and make the following call to the method:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>test1.print_text( &quot;The value was &quot;, aVal2 
  );</b></p>
<p>Again, the <b>print_text</b> method should show up on the NetBeans popup list.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/New_Class_print2.gif" width="351" height="236" alt="Method added to the list"></p>
<p>The values (parameters) that we specified are between the round brackets, along 
  with the return method, void.</p>
<p>But your main coding window should now look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/New_Class_print3.gif" width="436" height="297" border="1" alt="The whole of the Java code from our Main method"></p>
<p>The two values that we are passing over are separated by a comma. Notice that 
  the value inside of <b>aVal2</b> is being passed over. However, the variable 
  name inside of the round brackets of <b>print_text</b> is called <b>aVal</b>. 
  Although the two variable names are different, this doesn't matter. What you 
  are doing is passing values over to the method. So the variable aVal will end 
  up with the same value as aVal2.</p>
<p>If you run your programme now, you should see the following in the Output window:<br>
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/output_print.gif" width="323" height="130" border="1" alt="Output window"></p>
<p>We'll leave methods there for the time being. We'll be writing more methods 
  as we go along, so you should get plenty of practice. The next section is about 
  Classes - Object Oriented Programming.</p>
