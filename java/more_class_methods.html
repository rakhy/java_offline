<p>So we now have a student name and an exam name. Both are stored in the field 
  names in the StudentResults class. We can now add an exam score.</p>
<p>Add the following new method to your class, just after your examName method:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/classes/sr_examScore.gif" width="339" height="100" border="1" alt="A new method added to the java class"></p>
<p>This new method has the name <b>examScore</b>, with an int variable called 
  <b>aScore</b> between its round brackets. It's set to return a String value. 
  The method itself just combines the score with the string &quot; out of 50&quot;. 
  So if the value in aScore is 30, the text &quot;30 out of 50&quot; will be stored 
  in the Exam_Score field.</p>
<p>In your ExamDetails class, add the following line:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>String score = aStudent.examScore(30);</b></p>
<p>So we call the new <b>examScore</b> method and hand it a value of 30. The value 
  in the <b>Exam_Score</b> field is returned, and then stored in a string variable 
  that we've called score.</p>
<p>Add a new print line method so that your code looks like ours below:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/classes/exams_main_examScore.gif" width="453" height="274" border="1" alt="What your java Main method should look like now"></p>
<p>When the programme is run, the Output window now looks like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/classes/output_exam_score.gif" width="309" height="110" border="1" alt="Output window showing the results of the code"></p>
<p>So we have the student name, the exam name, and the score out of 50. We can 
  now add a grade to the output.</p>
<p>We'll use a single letter for the grade: A, B, C, D, or E. If the students 
  gets 41 or over, we'll an award an A; if the score is between 31 and 40, the 
  grade will be B; for a score of 21 to 30 a C grade will be awarded; a D grade 
  is between 11 and 20; and an E is for scores between 0 and 10.</p>
<p>Add the following method to calculate the above grades (add it to your StudentResults 
  class):</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/classes/sr_getGrade.gif" width="382" height="391" border="1" alt="A new java method to the exam grade"></p>
<p>Notice that this method is <b>private</b>. Just like field variables, making 
  a method private means it can only be seen inside of this class. It can't be 
  seen by the ExamDetails class.</p>
<p>To get the grade, we'll set up another method inside of the StudentResults 
  class. We'll use this to get the grade. Add the following method just above 
  the <b>getGrade</b> method (though you can add it below, if you prefer: it doesn't 
  make any difference to Java!):</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>String examGrade(int aScore) {</b></p>
<p><b><span class="TextIndent3">Exam_Grade = this.getGrade( aScore) ;</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">return Exam_Grade;</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent2">}</span></b></p>
<p>This is the method we'll call from the ExamDetails class, rather than the getGrade 
  method. The name of this new method is <b>examGrade</b>, and again we're passing 
  in the student's score. Look at this line, though:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>Exam_Grade = this.getGrade( aScore );</b></p>
<p>The getGrade method is being called, here, and we're passing it the score that 
  was handed over. Calling one method from another is standard practice, and it 
  allows you to simplify your code. The alternative is to have very long methods 
  that are hard to read. </p>
<p>Another thing to notice in the line above is the Java keyword <b>this</b>. 
  The <b>this</b> keyword means &quot;this class&quot;, rather than another class 
  that may have the same method name. It avoids any confusion. It's strictly not 
  necessary, and we could have left it out. The method call would still work without 
  it:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>Exam_Grade = getGrade( aScore );</b></p>
<p>The end result, though, is still the same: we're storing something in the Exam_Grade 
  field variable, and that something will be the text &quot;Grade is&quot; plus 
  a grade letter.</p>
<p>Add the following line to your ExamDetails class, to test out your new methods:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>String grade = aStudent.examGrade(30);</b></p>
<p>This line hands a value of 30 over to the examGrade method. The value in the 
  Exam_Grade field variable is then returned, and stored in a variable called 
  grade.</p>
<p>With a print line, your ExamDetails class should look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/classes/exams_main_examGrade.gif" width="457" height="313" border="1" alt="Getting the exam grade"></p>
<p>Run your programme to see the Output window:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/classes/sr_examGrade.gif" width="322" height="124" border="1" alt="Output window"></p>
<p>If your programme is not working properly, here's the full code for the <b>StudentResults</b> 
  class:</p>
