            <div data-role="content">
                <p>Now that we have some default values, we can add a method that sets some different 
                    values for them. Add the following method to your StudentResults class:</p>
                <p align="center"><img src="images/classes/sr_fullName.gif" width="310" height="387" border="1" alt="Adding a method that changes a field variable"></p>
                <p>This new method is called <b>fullName</b>, and has a String variable called 
                    <b>aName</b> between its round brackets. The method doesn't do a great deal, 
                    and is here for simplicity's sake. We could have had the method do more work, 
                    like checking it for errors, making sure it's proper case, checking for blank 
                    strings, etc. But the important point is that it sets a value for the <b>Full_Name</b> 
                    field, and returns this field as a value. When we call this method, it will 
                    overwrite the default value for Full_Name and insert a new value. Whatever is 
                    in the variable <b>aName</b> will be the new Full_Name value. Let's see it in 
                    action.</p>
                <p>Click back to your ExamDetails class. Add the following two lines:</p>
                <p class="TextIndent2"><b>String sName = aStudent.fullName(&quot;Bill Gates&quot;);<br>
                        System.out.println( sName );</b></p>
                <p>The code for your ExamDetails class should look like the one below:</p>
                <p align="center"><img src="images/classes/exams_main_fullName.gif" width="458" height="242" border="1" alt="Calling the new Java class method"></p>
                <p>What we're doing here is calling the <b>fullName</b> method of our <b>aStudent</b> 
                    object. We're handing over a value of &quot;Bill Gates&quot;. This will then 
                    be the value for the <b>Full_Name</b> field. (It could have been checked for 
                    errors, amended, and then stored in the field.) The Full_Name value is then 
                    returned and stored in the variable <b>sName</b>. </p>
                <p>Just like the methods we created in the previous section, though, our fullName 
                    method is on the NetBeans popup list. Notice that the constructor is not there, 
                    however:</p>
                <p align="center"><img src="images/classes/sr_fullName_list.gif" width="295" height="182" alt="The new method is on the NetBeans list"></p>
                <p>Run your code to test it out. The Output window should display the following:</p>
                <p align="center"><img src="images/classes/output_fullName.gif" width="318" height="94" border="1" alt="Output window 1"></p>
                <p>What we've done, then, is to set a value for a field variable in a class called 
                    <b>StudentResults</b>. We've then accessed that value and printed it out.</p>
                <p>Let's now add a method that actually does something useful. What we'll do is 
                    to allow a user to enter a two letter exam code. We'll then pass those two letters 
                    over to a method that turns the two letters into an exam name. For example, 
                    if a user enters the letter &quot;VB&quot;, the method will return the string 
                    &quot;Visual Basic .NET&quot;. The longer string will be stored in the Exam_Name 
                    field variable.</p>
                <p>Add the following code to your StudentResults class, just below your fullName 
                    method:</p>
                <p align="center"><img src="images/classes/sr_examName.gif" width="372" height="479" border="1" alt="A new Java method added to the class"></p>
                <p>The <b>examName</b> method has a string variable called examCode between its 
                    round brackets. This string will be the two letters. The IF &#133; ELSE IF lines 
                    check to see which two letters are in the string. If we find a match for the 
                    two letters then a longer exam title is placed into the Exam_Name field. If 
                    no match is found then the text will be &quot;No Exam Selected&quot;.</p>
                <p>Go back to your ExamDetails class and add the following line:</p>
                <p class="TextIndent2"><b>String exam = aStudent.examName(&quot;VB&quot;);</b></p>
                <p>Again, we're just making a call to the method. We hand over to the two letters 
                    &quot;VB&quot;. The method returns the value &quot;Visual Basic .NET&quot;, 
                    and then stores it in the string variable we've called exam. Add a new print 
                    line and your code should look like this:</p>
                <p align="center"><img src="images/classes/exams_main_examMethod.gif" width="457" height="257" border="1" alt="What your Java code should look like now"></p>
                <p>Run your code and the Output should be this:</p>
                <p align="center"><img src="images/classes/output_exam.gif" width="313" height="100" border="1" alt="Output window 2"></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>We'll continue this lesson in the next part, as the page is getting a bit too 
                    long!</p>
