<p>Actually, you have already written code to open a file. The process is no different 
  for the open file dialogue box. And because you have already written the classes 
  that open and write to a file, you can just import them into the current project.</p>
<p>To import a class that you have already written, have a look at the Properties 
  window on the left of NetBeans. (If you can't see the properties window, click 
  the <b>Window</b> menu item at the top of NetBeans. From the Window menu, select 
  <b>Properties</b>.)</p>
<p>Expand the entry for your current project, and right-click the Libraries item:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/add_project.gif" width="294" height="328" border="1" alt="Add a project"></p>
<p>From the menu that appears, select Add Project. When you do, you'll see the 
  following dialogue box:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/add_project_db.gif" width="467" height="414" alt="The Add Project dialogue box"></p>
<p>Make sure that the Look in box at the top says &quot;NetBeans Projects&quot;. 
  Now scroll down and locate your TextFiles project. This is where your classes 
  are that open and write to a file. Now click the &quot;Add project JAR files&quot; 
  button. The dialogue box will close and you'll be returned to NetBeans. Have 
  a look at the Libraries entry for your current project and you'll see that it 
  has been imported:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/add_project_imported.gif" width="223" height="128" border="1" alt="The project has been imported"></p>
<p>Now that you've added the classes to your project, you can add an import line 
  to the top of your code:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>import textfiles.ReadFile;</b></p>
<p>If your recall, ReadFile was what we called the class that opened a file. The 
  package name we came up with was called textfiles. We're now importing the ReadFile 
  class, and can now create new objects from it.</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>ReadFile file_read = new ReadFile( file_name );</b></p>
<p>Adapt your IF Statement to add the following <b>try &#133;catch</b> code:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/fileChooser_open_code.gif" width="485" height="367" alt="Java code that opens a text file" border="1"></p>
<p>The code is just about the same as when we opened a text file previously: get 
  the name of the file and create a new <b>ReadFile</b> object, call the <b>openFile</b> 
  method we created, and return all the lines as an array, then loop round reading 
  each line. Notice that we place all the lines in the text area control on our 
  form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Exercise</b><br>
  One thing missing, however, is a message in the <b>catch</b> part of the<b> 
  try &#133; catch</b> block. Move your message box between the curly brackets 
  of catch. In between the round brackets of <b>showMessageDialog</b> add a suitable 
  message. Or you can simply use <b>e.getMessage</b>.</p>
<p><br>
  When you've completed the code, try it out. You should be to open a file using 
  your File &gt; Open menu. The text file should then appear in your text area 
  field.</p>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
