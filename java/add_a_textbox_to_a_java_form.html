<p>What our form needs now is a text box and some buttons. Let's add the text 
  box first. </p>
<p>Locate the Text Field control in the Palette:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/palette_textField.gif" width="302" height="365" alt="The Text Field control in the NetBeans Palette"></p>
<p>Controls in the NetBeans Palette can be dragged onto a form. So click on Text 
  Field to select it. Now hold you left mouse button down on the Text Field. Keep 
  it held down and drag the control onto the form:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/textField_mouse.gif" width="342" height="282" border="1" alt="A Text Filed being dragged on to a Java Form"></p>
<p>Let go anywhere on the form:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/textField_dropped.gif" width="342" height="282" border="1" alt="A Text Field dropped on to the form"></p>
<p>The squares around the text field are sizing handles. You can hold down your 
  left mouse button on one of the squares and drag to a new width or height. The 
  dotted lines are position indicators, one for the left position and one for 
  the top position. Notice that the default name for the text field is <b>jTextField1</b>. 
  Let's change that.</p>
<p>With the text field selected, have a look at the <b>Inspector</b> area in the 
  bottom left: (If you can't see an Inspector area, click <b>Window &gt; Navigating 
  &gt; Inspector</b> from the NetBeans menu bar.)</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/inspector_TF.gif" width="288" height="153" alt="Inspector area showing a default Text Field"></p>
<p>As you can see, <b>jTextField1</b> is selected in the Inspector. This area 
  shows you what objects you have on your forms. You can also rename an object 
  from here. To do so, right click on jTextField1. From the menu that appears, 
  select <b>Change Variable Name</b>.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/inspector_changeVarName.gif" width="390" height="305" alt="Renaming a Java Text Field" border="1"></p>
<p>When you click on Change Variable Name, a dialogue box appears. Type a new 
  name for the Text Field. Call it <b>txtDisplay</b>:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/inspector_changeVarName2.gif" width="294" height="125" alt="Type a new name for the Text Field"></p>
<p>Click OK. When you do, NetBeans will rename your text field:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/inspector_TF_renamed.gif" width="288" height="153" border="1" alt="The Text Field has now been renamed"></p>
<p>Now have a look at your code again by clicking the <b>Source</b> button in 
  the main window. When your code appears, scroll down to the bottom. You'll see 
  that a new private field variable has been added:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/code_swing_textfield.gif" width="464" height="233" border="1" alt="Java code shows the name of the new  Text Field"></p>
<p>So a <b>JTextField</b> variable has been set up with the name <b>txtDisplay</b>. 
  The &quot;javax.swing&quot; part is a reference to a set of packages that are 
  used for GUI development. Swing makes it easier for you to create forms and 
  the controls on forms.</p>
<p>Click on the <b>Design</b> button at the top to return to your form. The text 
  field has some default text in, at the moment. You can add your own text by 
  changing the text property of the text field.</p>
<p>Make sure your text field is selected on the form. Now locate text in the properties 
  window:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/properties_text.gif" width="303" height="364" border="1" alt="Default text for the Text Field property"></p>
<p>Delete the default text of <b>jTextField1</b> and leave it blank:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/properties_text2.gif" width="303" height="363" border="1" alt="Leave the text property blank"></p>
<p>Then press the enter key on your keyboard. Have a look at your text field object 
  on the form. It may well have changed size. Use the sizing handles to resize 
  it. You'll see that it now has no text in it at all:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/textField_blank.gif" width="342" height="282" border="1" alt="A  blank text field on a Java form"></p>
<p>The text field on our calculator will obviously be used for the output of the 
  calculation. But it won't work without buttons. You'll see how to add those 
  in the next part of this tutorial.</p>
