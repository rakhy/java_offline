<P>You can check to see which single character is in a particular string. The 
  <b>charAt</b> method is used for this in Java. Here's some code to try:</P>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>String email_address = &quot;meme@me.com&quot;;</b></p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>char aChar = email_address.charAt( 4 );<br>
  System.out.println( aChar );</b></p>
<p>This code checks which letter as at position 4 in the email address string. 
  The return value is a variable of type <b>char</b>:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>char aChar = email_address.charAt( 4 );</b></p>
<p>When the above code is run, the output is the character @. The number between 
  the round brackets of charAt is the position in the string you're trying to 
  check. Here, we want to get at the character in position 4 of the email_address 
  string. Again, the count starts at 0, just like substring.</p>
<p>One good use for charAt is for taking a letter from a string variable that 
  is typed by a user, and then converting it to a single char variable. For example, 
  you could ask the user to type Y to continue or an N to exit. Have a look at 
  this code:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/strings/charAt.gif" width="402" height="317" border="1" alt="Java code showing use of the charAt method"></p>
<p>We can't use the Scanner class directly to get a single letter to store in 
  a char variable. So we use the next( ) method to get the next string that the 
  user inputs. There's a next integer, next long, next double - even a next Boolean. 
  But there's no next char. Even if the user inputs a single character it will 
  still be a string and not a char. (Remember: a char variable stores a Unicode 
  number as an integer.) </p>
<p>We can use charAt to get a character from any string that the user inputs, 
  even if the user inputs a single letter:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>char aChar = aString.charAt( 0 );</b></p>
<p>All we're saying is &quot;Get the character at position 0 in the string called 
  aString, then store it in the aChar variable&quot;.</p>
<p>We've added an IF statement to test what is in the aChar variable. (Note the 
  use of single quotes around the letter Y.)</p>
