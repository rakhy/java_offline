<P>The arrays you have been using so far have only held one column of data. But 
  you can set up an array to hold more than one column. These are called multi-dimensional 
  arrays. As an example, think of a spreadsheet with rows and columns. If you 
  have 6 rows and 5 columns then your spreadsheet can hold 30 numbers. It might 
  look like this:</P>
<p align="center"><img src="images/arrays/array_image_2D.gif" width="345" height="139" border="1" alt="A representation of a 2-dimensional array"></p>
<p>A multi dimensional array is one that can hold all the values above. You set 
  them up like this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>int[ ][ ] aryNumbers = new int[</b>6<b>][</b>5<b>];</b></p>
<p>They are set up in the same way as a normal array, except you have two sets 
  of square brackets. The first set of square brackets is for the rows and the 
  second set of square brackets is for the columns. In the above line of code, 
  we're telling Java to set up an array with 6 rows and 5 columns. To hold values 
  in a multi-dimensional array you have to take care to track the rows and columns. 
  Here's some code to fill the first rows of numbers from our spreadsheet image:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>aryNumbers[0][0] = 10;<br>
  aryNumbers[0][1] = 12;<br>
  aryNumbers[0][2] = 43;<br>
  aryNumbers[0][3] = 11;<br>
  aryNumbers[0][4] = 22;</b></p>
<p>So the first row is row 0. The columns then go from 0 to 4, which is 5 items. 
  To fill the second row, it would be this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>aryNumbers[1][0] = 20;<br>
  aryNumbers[1][1] = 45;<br>
  aryNumbers[1][2] = 56;<br>
  aryNumbers[1][3] = 1;<br>
  aryNumbers[1][4] = 33;</b></p>
<p> The column numbers are the same, but the row numbers are now all 1.</p>
<p>To access all the items in a multi-dimensional array the technique is to use 
  one loop inside of another. Here's some code to access all our number from above. 
  It uses a double for loop:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/arrays/double_for_loop.gif" width="429" height="243" border="1" alt="Java code showing how to use two for loops with a 2-dimensional array"></p>
<p>The first for loop is used for the rows; the second for loop is for the columns. 
  The first time round the first loop, the value of the variable i will be 0. 
  The code inside of the for loop is another loop. The whole of this second loop 
  will be executed while the value of the variable i is 0. The second for loop 
  use a variable called j. The i and the j variables can then be used to access 
  the array.</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>aryNumbers[ i ][ j ]</b></p>
<p>So the two loop system is used to go through all the values in a multi-dimensional 
  array, row by row.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Multi-dimensional arrays can be quite tricky, but mainly because it's hard 
  to keep track of all your rows and columns! In the next part, you'll learn about 
  array lists.</p>
