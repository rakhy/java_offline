            <div data-role="content">
            </span>Now that the number buttons are working on your Java calculator, the next thing 
  to do is to handle the plus button. The only thing our plus button needs to 
  do is to store whatever number is currently in the text field. It's just a record 
  of the first number to be added. Later, we'll also record the fact that it was 
  the plus button that was clicked, rather than the minus, or the divide, or the 
  multiply button.</p>
<p>To store the value, we need to set up a field variable, that's a variable outside 
  of any button code. This is so that all the buttons can see what has been stored 
  in it.</p>
<p>Add the following variable near the top of the coding window: (You can place 
  it near the bottom, with the field variables NetBeans has set up for the form 
  objects, but we'll keep our variables separate.)</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>private double total1 = 0.0;</b></p>
<p>Here's the code window:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/field_var_total1.gif" width="456" height="150" border="1" alt="Java code showing a double variable"></p>
<p>So we're setting up a variable called <b>total1</b>. The type of variable is 
  a <b>double</b>. Its default value is 0.0.</p>
<p>To store the value from the text field, we need to get the text. But we'll 
  need to convert it from a String to a Double. You can do so with the parseDouble 
  method of the Double object:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>Double.parseDouble( txtDisplay.getText( ) )</b></p>
<p>In between the round brackets of parseDouble we get the text from the txtDisplay 
  text field.</p>
<p>However, when we store the value from the text field into the <b>total1</b> 
  variable, we need to retain what is already in total1. We can also clear the 
  text field, ready for the second number. </p>
<p>So return to Design view in NetBeans. Double click your Plus button to generate 
  the code stub. Now add the following two lines to your plus button:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>total1 = total1 + Double.parseDouble( txtDisplay.getText( 
  ) ) ;<br>
  txtDisplay.setText(&quot;&quot;);</b></p>
<p>In between the round brackets of setText, we have a pair of double quotes, 
  with no space between them. This is enough to clear the text field.</p>
<p>And that's it for the Plus button, for the moment. We'll come back to it later. 
  All we're doing, though, is storing a number in the total1 variable, and keeping 
  what is already there. Once the number is stored, we've cleared the text field. 
  The user can now enter a second number to be added to the first.</p>
<p>in the next part, we'll add code for the equals button on our calcualtor.</p>
