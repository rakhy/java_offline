<p>Radio buttons are usually used to select just one item from a list, rather 
  than the multiple items available with check boxes. Let's see how they work.</p>
<p>Drag and drop a panel onto your form. Then locate the Radio Button control 
  in the NetBeans palette. Drag a Radio button onto your new palette. It should 
  look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/radButton.gif" width="126" height="122" alt="A Radio Button dragged onto a Java Form" border="1"></p>
<p>The default text for the first radio button is <b>jRadioButton1</b>. We'll 
  use our radio buttons to allow a user to select a payment method. So change 
  the text of your radio button to <b>Credit Card</b>. (The text can be changed 
  in the same way as you did for check boxes. Again, we'll leave the variable 
  name on the default of <b>jRadioButton1</b>.)</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/radButton_rename.gif" width="126" height="114" border="1" alt="Rename the Radio Button"></p>
<p>Add two more radio buttons to the panel. Change the text to Debit Card, and 
  PayPal:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/radButton_rename2.gif" width="132" height="121" border="1" alt="Three Radio Buttons added to  a Java Form"></p>
<p>There is, however, a problem with the radio buttons you've just added. To see 
  what the problem is, run your programme again. Now select one of the radio buttons. 
  Try selecting another radio button and you'll find that you can indeed select 
  more than one at the same time:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/radButton_selected.gif" width="121" height="95" border="1" alt="All three buttons are selected"></p>
<p>With our radio buttons, though, we only want the user to select one payment 
  option. To solve the problem, Java lets you to create something called a <b>ButtonGroup</b>. 
  As its name suggest, this allows you to group buttons under one name. You can 
  then add radio buttons to the group. Once you've added buttons to the group, 
  only one option is available for selection.</p>
<p>To see how the ButtonGroup works, add the following method to your code, somewhere 
  near the top:</p>
<p><span class="TextIndent2"><b>private void groupButton( ) {</b></span><br>
  <br>
  <span class="TextIndent3"><b>ButtonGroup bg1 = new ButtonGroup( );</b></span></p>
<p class="TextIndent3"><b>bg1.add(jRadioButton1);<br>
  bg1.add(jRadioButton2);<br>
  bg1.add(jRadioButton3);</b></p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>}</b></p>
<p>When you do, you'll see that NetBeans has alerted to you to a problem, and 
  underlined some code in red. It has done this because it can't find a class 
  called ButtonGroup, so can't create a new object from it.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, you need to import the relevant class from the Swing 
  library. So scroll up to the very top of your code, and add the following import 
  statement:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>import javax.swing.ButtonGroup;</b></p>
<p>The red underline should now be gone.</p>
<p>Our groupButton method adds radio buttons to the ButtonGroup object, with the 
  use of the add method:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>bg1.add( radio_button_name );</b></p>
<p>There's one line for every radio button on our form.</p>
<p>We can call the groupButton method from the constructor. That way, the radio 
  buttons will be grouped when the form loads. Add the following method call to 
  your constructor:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/radButton_call.gif" width="319" height="100" alt="A call from a Java constructor" border="1"></p>
<p>The top of your code window should look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/radButton_top_code.gif" width="443" height="199" border="1" alt="Code so far"></p>
<p>Run your form again, and try to select more than one radio button. You should 
  find that you can only select one in the group.</p>
<p>To get at which radio button was selected, again there's an <b>isSelected</b> 
  method we can use.</p>
<p>Add a normal button to your form. When we click this button we'll display a 
  message box stating which radio button was clicked. </p>
<p>Change the variable name of your button to btnRadios. Change the text property 
  to Payment Option. </p>
<p>Now double click your new button to create a code stub. Add the following:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/radButton_code.gif" width="341" height="245" border="1" alt="Java code to select a Radio Button option"></p>
<p>All we're doing here is checking which radio button is selected. We're then 
  getting the text from the radio button and storing it in a variable called radioText.</p>
<p>We can have a message box to display which payment option was selected. Add 
  the following line to the bottom of your button code, just below the final IF 
  statement:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><font size="2"><b>javax.swing.JOptionPane.showMessageDialog( 
  FormObjects.this, radioText );</b></font></p>
<p>This line is so long that we've had to reduce the font size! But you've met 
  the JOptionPane in a previous section. The only difference is the first item 
  between the round brackets. Because we were using a console, the first item 
  was null. Now we have:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>FormObjects.this</b></p>
<p>The first item between the round brackets is for the window in which you want 
  to display the message box. <b>Null</b> meant no window. <b>FormObjects.this</b> 
  means this component (the form) of the FormObjects class.</p>
<p>Run your programme again, and select an item from your radio button. Then click 
  your button. You should see something like the following:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/forms/resize_form_message.gif" width="484" height="196" border="1" alt="A Java form showing that a Radio button option has been selected"></p>
<p>In the next part, you'll see how to add menus to your Java Forms.</p>
