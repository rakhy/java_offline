<P>You can pass values to your methods so that something can be done with this 
  value. That value goes between the round brackets of the method. </P>
<p>Switch back to <a href="java_method_calling.html">your MyMethods class</a>. 
  Now add the second of our total methods:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/New_Class_total2.gif" width="395" height="376" border="1" alt="Java code showing a method with a  parameter"></p>
<p>We now have two methods with the same name: <b>total</b>. The difference between 
  the two is that this new one has a value between the round brackets. Java allows 
  you to do this, and it is called <b>method overloading</b>. You can have as 
  many methods with the same name as you want, with any return value. However, 
  you can't have the same type of variables between the round brackets. So you 
  can't have two total methods that return int values with both of them having 
  int values between the round brackets. You can't do this, for example:</p>
<p><span class="TextIndent2"><b>int total( int aNumber ) {</b></span><b><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">int a_Value = aNumber + 20;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span class="TextIndent3">return a_Value;</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent2">}</span></b></p>
<p><span class="TextIndent2"><b>int total( int aNumber ) {</b></span><b><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">int a_Value = aNumber + 50;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span class="TextIndent3">return a_Value;</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent2">}</span></b></p>
<p>Although the two methods do different things, they have the same method headers.</p>
<p>Before you try out your new method, add some comments directly above the method:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/New_Class_total2_comments.gif" width="400" height="207" border="1" alt="Javadoc comments added to the  method"></p>
<p>You'll see what the comments do in a moment. But the <b>param</b> in the comments 
  above is short for <b>parameter</b>. A parameter is the technical term for the 
  value between the round brackets of your method headers. Our parameter is called 
  <b>aNumber</b>, and it has an integer values. Note the use of the @ character 
  before <b>param</b> and <b>return</b>.</p>
<p>All we're doing with the method itself is passing it an integer value and adding 
  20 to this passed value. The return value is the total of the two.</p>
<p>Now switch back to your code and add the following line:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>int aVal2 = test1.total(30);</b></p>
<p>As soon as you type the dot after your <b>test1</b> object, you'll see the 
  popup list again. Your new total method will be on it. Click on the new method 
  to highlight it and NetBeans will display the following:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/New_Class_total2_comments2.gif" width="439" height="484" border="1" alt="The Javadoc comments are displayed"></p>
<p>The comments that we added are now displayed in the blue box underneath the 
  list of methods. Anyone else coming across your method should be able to figure 
  out what it does. The @param and @return lines from the comments are now filled 
  out, and made bold.</p>
<p>But once you have added the total2 method, type the number 30 between the round 
  brackets. Then type a semi-colon to end the line. You main method should now 
  look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/New_Class_total2_call.gif" width="429" height="252" border="1" alt="A new method call from the main programme"></p>
<p>The 30 between the round brackets of the new total method will be handed over 
  and placed in the variable aNumber, which is in the round brackets of the method 
  header:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/method_header_arrows2.gif" width="289" height="242" alt="Values being handed over to the method"></p>
<p>Once you have handed the value over, the method can get to work.</p>
<p>Add a print line to your code:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>System.out.println( &quot;Method result2= &quot; + aVal2 
  );</b></p>
<p>Then run your programme. The Output window should display the following:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/methods/output_int2.gif" width="314" height="112" border="1" alt="Output window for above code"></p>
<p>So our new total method has added 30 to 20, and then returned the answer to 
  the variable called aVal2.</p>
<p>In the next lesson, you'll learn how to pass more than one value over to your 
  methods.</p>
