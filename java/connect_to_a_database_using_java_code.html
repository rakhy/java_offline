<p>In a later section, you'll create a Java form that loads information from a 
  database. The form will have Next and Previous to scroll through the data. Individual 
  records will then be displayed in text fields. We'll also add button to Update 
  a record, Delete a record, and create a new record in the database.</p>
<p>To get started, and for simplicity's sake, we'll use a terminal/console window 
  to output the results from a database.</p>
<p>So start a new project for this by clicking <b>File &gt; New Project</b> from 
  the NetBeans menu. Create a <b>Java Application</b>. Call the package <b>database_consol</b>e, 
  and the Main class <b>DBConnect</b>:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/databases/new_db_console.gif" width="404" height="303" alt="The New Project dialogue box in NetBeans" border="1"></p>
<p>When you click Finish, your code should look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/databases/console_blank_code.gif" width="366" height="147" alt="Default Java code" border="1"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Connecting to the Database</h2>
<p>To connect to a database you need a Connection object. The Connection object 
  uses a DriverManager. The DriverManager passes in your database username, your 
  password, and the location of the database.</p>
<p>Add these three import statements to the top of your code:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>import java.sql.Connection;<br>
  import java.sql.DriverManager;<br>
  import java.sql.SQLException;</b></p>
<p>To set up a connection to a database, the code is this:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b><font size="2">Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(</font></b><font size="2"> 
  host, username, password <b>);</b></font></p>
<p>So the DriverManager has a method called getConnection. This needs a host name 
  (which is the location of your database), a username, and a password. If a connection 
  is successful, a Connection object is created, which we've called <b>con</b>.</p>
<p>You can get the host address by looking at the Services tab on the left of 
  NetBeans:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/databases/services_host.gif" width="364" height="265" alt="The host address of the database" border="1"></p>
<p>The address of the highlighted database above is:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/Employees</b></p>
<p>The first part, <b>jdbc:derby://localhost</b>, is the database type and server 
  that you're using. The 1527 is the port number. The database is <b>Employees</b>. 
  This can all go in a String variable:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>String host = &quot;jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/Employees&quot;;</b></p>
<p>Two more strings can be added for the username and password:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>String uName = &quot;Your_Username_Here&quot;;<br>
  String uPass= &quot; Your_Password_Here &quot;;</b></p>
<p>Add these three string before the connection object and your code would look 
  like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/databases/connection_code.gif" width="483" height="308" alt="Java code to set up a database connection object" border="1"></p>
<p>As you can see in the image above, there is a wavy underline for the Connection 
  code. The reason for this is because we haven't trapped a specific error that 
  will be thrown up when connecting to a database - the SQLException error.</p>
<p>It's the DriverManager that attempts to connect to the database. If it fails 
  (incorrect host address, for example) then it will hand you back a SQLException 
  error. You need to write code to deal with this potential error. In the code 
  below, we're trapping the error in catch part of the <b>try &#133; catch</b> 
  statement:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>try {</b></p>
<p><b><span class="TextIndent2">}</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent2">catch ( SQLException err ) {</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent3">System.out.println( err.getMessage( ) );</span><br>
  <span class="TextIndent2">}</span></b></p>
<p>In between the round brackets of catch, we've set up a SQLException object 
  called <b>err</b>. We can then use the <b>getMessage</b> method of this err 
  object.<br>
  <br>
  Add the above <b>try &#133;catch</b> block to your own code, and move your four 
  connection lines of code to the try part. Your code will then look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/databases/connection_code2.gif" width="506" height="212" alt="Catching a SQLException error" border="1"></p>
<p>Try running your code and see what happens.</p>
<p>You may get this error message in the console window:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"> <b>&quot;java.net.ConnectException : Error connecting 
  to server localhost on port 1527 with message Connection refused: connect.&quot;</b></p>
<p>If you do, it means you haven't connected to your database server. In which 
  case, right click on Java DB in the Services window. From the menu that appears, 
  click Start Server:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/databases/services_start_server.gif" width="364" height="219" alt="Start the JAVA DB server"></p>
<p>You need to make sure that any firewall you may have is not blocking the connection 
  to the server. A good firewall will immediately display a message alerting you 
  that something is trying to get through, and asking if you want to allow or 
  deny it. When you allow the connection, your NetBeans output window should print 
  the following message:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>&quot;Apache Derby Network Server - 10.4.1.3 - (648739) 
  started and ready to accept connections on port 1527 at DATE_AND_TIME_HERE&quot;</b></p>
<p>Once your server is started, run the programme again. There's a very good chance 
  you'll get another error message:</p>
<p align="center"><b>&quot;No suitable driver found for jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/Employees&quot;</b></p>
<p>The reason for this error is that the DriverManager needs a Driver in order 
  to connect to the database. Examples of drivers are Client Drivers and Embedded 
  Drivers. You can import one of these so that the DriverManager can do its job.</p>
<p>Click on the <b>Projects</b> tab to the left of the <b>Services</b> window 
  in NetBeans. (If you can't see a Projects tab, click <b>Window &gt; Projects</b> 
  from the menu bar at the top of NetBeans.)</p>
<p>Locate your project and expand the entry. Right-click <b>Libraries</b>. From 
  the menu that appears, select<b> Add Jar/Folder</b>:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/databases/projects_add_jar.gif" width="338" height="263" alt="The Add JAR/Folder menu"></p>
<p>When you click on Add Jar/Folder a dialogue box appears. What you're doing 
  here is adding a Java Archive file to your project. But the JAR file you're 
  adding is for the derby Client Drivers. So you need to locate this folder. On 
  a computer running Windows this will be in the following location:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>C:\Program Files\Sun\JavaDB\lib</b></p>
<p>The file you're looking for is called <b>derbyclient.jar</b>. If you can't 
  find it, or are using an operating system other than Windows, then do a search 
  for this file. Note the location of the file.</p>
<p>In the dialogue box, select the <b>derbyclient.jar</b> file:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/databases/projects_add_jar_DB.gif" width="503" height="328" alt="The Add Jar/Folder dialogue box"></p>
<p>Click Open and the file will be added to your project library:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/databases/projects_add_jar_client.gif" width="324" height="182" alt="The JAR file has been added to the project"></p>
<p>Now that you have a Client driver added to your project, run your programme 
  again. You should now be error free. (The Output window will just say Run, and 
  Build Successful.)</p>
