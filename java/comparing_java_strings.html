</p>You can compare one string to another. (When comparing, Java will use the hexadecimal 
  values rather than the letters themselves.) For example, if you wanted to compare 
  the word &quot;Ape&quot; with the word &quot;App&quot; to see which should come 
  first, you can use an inbuilt string method called <b>compareTo</b>. Let's see 
  how it works.<p></P>
<p>You don't need to start a new project for this: simply comment out (or delete) 
  <a href="upper_lower_case.html">the code you already have</a>. Now add the following 
  code:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/strings/compareTo.gif" width="488" height="454" border="1" alt="Java code showing an exmple of compareTo"></p>
<p>We've set up two string variables to contain the words &quot;Ape&quot; and 
  &quot;App&quot;. The compareTo method is then this line in the code above:</p>
<p class="TextIndent2"><b>result = Word1.compareTo( Word2 );</b></p>
<p>The <b>compareTo</b> method returns a value. The value that is returned will 
  be greater than 0, less than 0, or have a value of zero. If Word1 comes before 
  Word2, then the value that is returned will be less than 0. If Word1 comes after 
  Word2 then the value returned will be greater than 0. If the two words are identical 
  then a value of 0 will be returned. </p>
<p>So you need to assign the value that compareTo returns to a variable. We're 
  placing the value in an integer variable called result. The IF Statements in 
  the code simply tests to see what is in the result variable</p>
<p>However, when you compare one string of text with another, Java compares the 
  underlying hexadecimals values, rather than the actual letters. Because uppercase 
  letters have a lower hexadecimal value than lowercase ones, an uppercase letter 
  &quot;A&quot; in &quot;App&quot; will come before a lowercase letter &quot;a&quot; 
  in &quot;ape&quot;. Try it for yourself. Change &quot;Ape&quot; to &quot;ape&quot; 
  in your code. The Output will read &quot;Word1 is more than Word2&quot;, meaning 
  that Java will place the word &quot;ape&quot; after the word &quot;app&quot; 
  alphabetically. </p>
<p>To solve the problem, there's a related method called compareToIgnoreCase. 
  As its name suggest, lowercase and uppercase letter are ignored. Use this and 
  &quot;ape will come before &quot;App&quot; alphabetically.<br>
</p>
<p>Next up, we'll look at another useful String method - indexOf.</p>
