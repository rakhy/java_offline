                <P>Another way to control the flow of your programmes is with something called 
                    a switch statement. A switch statement gives you the option to test for a range 
                    of values for your variables. They can be used instead of long, complex<b> if 
                        &#133; else if</b> statements. The structure of the switch statement is this:</P>
                <p><b>switch ( </b>variable_to_test<b> ) {<br>
                        <span class="TextIndent2">case value: </span><br>
                        <span class="TextIndent3">code_here;</span><br>
                        <span class="TextIndent3">break;</span><br>
                        <span class="TextIndent2">case value:</span> <br>
                        <span class="TextIndent3">code_here;</span><br>
                        <span class="TextIndent3">break;</span><br>
                        <span class="TextIndent2">default:</span><br>
                        <span class="TextIndent3">values_not_caught_above;</span></b></p>
                <p><b>}</b></p>
                <p>So you start with the word <b>switch</b>, followed by a pair of round brackets. 
                    The variable you want to check goes between the round brackets of switch. You 
                    then have a pair of curly brackets. The other parts of the switch statement 
                    all go between the two curly brackets. For every value that you want to check, 
                    you need the word <b>case</b>. You then have the value you want to check for:</p>
                <p class="TextIndent3"><b>case</b> value: </p>
                <p>After case value comes a colon. You then put what you want to happen if the 
                    value matches. This is your code that you want executed. The keyword <b>break</b> 
                    is needed to break out of each case of the switch statement.</p>
                <p>The default value at the end is optional. It can be included if there are other 
                    values that can be held in your variable but that you haven't checked for elsewhere 
                    in the switch statement.</p>
                <p>If all of that is confusing, here's some code to try out. You can either start 
                    a new project for this, or just comment out the code you have. A quick way to 
                    comment out code in NetBeans is from the toolbar at the top. First, highlight 
                    the code you want to comment out. Then click the comment icon:</p>
                <p align="center"><img src="images/started/comment_icon.gif" width="130" height="66" border="1" alt="The Java comment icon on the NetBeans toolbar"></p>
                <p>But here's the code:</p>
                <p align="center"><img src="images/con_logic/switch_statement.gif" width="459" height="348" border="1" alt="Code demonstrating a Java switch statement"></p>
                <p>The first thing the code does is to set a value to test for. Again, we've set 
                    up an integer variable and called it <b>user</b>. We've set the value to 18. 
                    The switch statement will check the user variable and see what's in it. It will 
                    then go through each of the case statements in turn. When it finds one that 
                    matches, it will stop and execute the code for that case. It will then break 
                    out of the switch statement.</p>
                <p>Try the programme out. Enter various values for the user variable and see what 
                    happens. </p>
                <p>Sadly, you can't test for a range of values after case, just the one value. 
                    So you can't do this:</p>
                <p class="TextIndent2"><b>case (user &lt;= 18):</b></p>
                <p>But you can do this:</p>
                <p class="TextIndent2"><b>case 1: case 2: case 3: case 4:</b></p>
                <p>So the above line tests for a range of values, from 1 to 4. But you have to 
                    &quot;spell out&quot; each value. (Notice where all the case and colons are.)</p>

                <p><b>Exercise C</b><br>
                    Write a programme that accepts user input from the console. The programme should 
                    take a number and then test for the following age ranges: 0 to 10, 11 to 20, 
                    21 to 30, 30 and over. Display a message in the Output window in the following 
                    format:</p>
                <p class="TextIndent2"><b>user_age + &quot; is between 21 and 30&quot;</b></p>
                <p>So if the user enters 27 as the age, the Output window should be this:</p>
                <p align="center"><img src="images/con_logic/age_exercise_output.gif" width="425" height="137" border="1" alt="Output of the Java exercise"></p>
                <p>If the user is 30 or over, you can just display the following message:</p>
                <p class="TextIndent2"><b>&quot;You are 30 or over&quot;</b></p>
				
				<p align="right"><a href = "java_answers_c.html">Answer to Exercise C</a></p
                ><p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><b>Help for this exercise</b></p>
                <p>To get string values from the user, you did this:</p>
                <p class="TextIndent2"><b>String age = user_input.next( );</b></p>
                <p>But the <b>next</b>( ) method is used for strings. The age you are getting 
                    from the user has to be an integer, so you can't use next( ). There is, however, 
                    a similar method you can use: <b>nextInt</b>( ). </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><b>Exercise D</b><br>
                    If you want to check if one String is the same as another, you can use a Method 
                    called <b>equals</b>. </p>
                <p class="TextIndent2"><b>String user_name = &quot;Bill&quot;;</b></p>
                <p><b><span class="TextIndent2">if ( </span></b><span class="TextIndent2">user_name.<b>equals</b>( 
                        &quot;Bill&quot; )</span><b><span class="TextIndent2"> ) {</span><br>
                        <span class="TextIndent3">//DO SOMETHING HERE</span><br>
                        <span class="TextIndent2">} </span></b></p>
                <p>In the code above, we've set up a String variable and called it user_name. 
                    We've then assigned a value of &quot;Bill&quot; to it. In between the round 
                    brackets of IF we have the variable name again, followed by a dot. After the 
                    dot comes the word &quot;equals&quot;. In between another pair of round brackets 
                    you type the string you're trying to test for.</p>
                <p>NOTE: When checking if one string is the same as another, they have to match 
                    exactly. So &quot;Bill&quot; is different from &quot;bill&quot;. The first has 
                    an uppercase letter &quot;B&quot; and the second has a lowercase &quot;b&quot;.</p>
                <p><br>
                    For this exercise, write a programme that asks a user to choose between four 
                    colours: black, white, red, or blue. Use IF &#133; ELSE IF statements to display 
                    one of the following messages, depending on which colour was chosen:</p>
                <p><span class="TextIndent2"><b>BLACK</b> &quot;You must be a Goth!&quot;</span><br>
                    <span class="TextIndent2"><b>WHITE</b> &quot;You are a very pure person&quot;</span><br>
                    <span class="TextIndent2"><b>RED</b> &quot;You are fun and outgoing&quot;</span><br>
                    <span class="TextIndent2"><b>BLUE</b> &quot;You're not a Chelsea fan, are you?&quot;</span></p>
                <p>When your programme ends, the Output window should look like something like 
                    this:</p>
                <p align="center"><img src="images/con_logic/colour_exercise_output.gif" width="425" height="137" border="1" alt="Output window showing results of Java  exercise"></p>

                <p>OK, let's move on and have a look at loops. We'll be upping the pace a bit
