</span>In the previous lesson, you created records in your Java DB database table. 
  In this lesson, you'll learn a few SQL commands so that you can manipulate records 
  in a table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SQL stands for <b>Structured Query Languag</b>e, and is a way to query databases. 
  You can select records, insert, delete, and update records, create tables, drop 
  tables, and more besides. It's quite a powerful tool.</p>
<p>SQL uses simple keywords to do the work. If you want to select all the records 
  from a table, the words SELECT and FROM are used, along with the &quot;all records&quot; 
  symbol, which is <b>*</b>:</p>
<p align="center"><b>SELECT * FROM table_name</b></p>
<p>If you look at the top half of the NetBeans window, you'll see that a SELECT 
  statement has already been set up: (NOTE: SQL is not case sensitive)</p>
<p align="center"><b>select * from ADMIN.WORKERS</b></p>
<p>This says &quot;Select all the records from the table called Workers&quot;. 
  (The ADMIN part, before the dot of Workers, is something called a Schema. This 
  describes the structure of the database, but also identifies things like users 
  and the privileges they have. Don't worry about schemas, as we won't be going 
  into them.)</p>
<p>In NetBeans, you run a SQL statement by clicking the <b>Run</b> button on the 
  toolbar:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/databases/run_SQL_icon.gif" width="509" height="55" alt="The Run SQL icon" border="1"></p>
<p>The results from the SQL statements are then displayed in the bottom half of 
  the window:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/databases/Insert_Record_Row2.gif" width="377" height="96" border="1" alt="All the records in the table have been selected"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The WHERE Clause</h3>
<p>To narrow down your search results, you can use a WHERE clause with the SELECT 
  statement:</p>
<p align="center"><b>SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name=value</b></p>
<p>After the keyword WHERE you need the name of a column from your table. You 
  then type an equals sign, followed by a value. As an example, here's a SQL statement 
  that returns all the programmers in our table:</p>
<p align="center"><b>SELECT * FROM ADMIN.WORKERS WHERE JOB_TITLE='Programmer'</b></p>
<p>To try this SQL Statement out, right-click your table name in the <b>Services</b> 
  area. From the menu that appears, select <b>Execute Command</b>:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/databases/run_SQL_execute.gif" width="364" height="265" alt="The Execute Command menu item"></p>
<p>When you click on Execute Command, a new window appears. Type the above SQL 
  Statement, and then click the Run icon:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/databases/run_SQL_execute2.gif" width="476" height="62" alt="Running a SQL command" border="1"></p>
<p>The results will be displayed in the bottom half of the window:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/databases/run_SQL_results.gif" width="391" height="99" alt="The results from the SQL command" border="1"></p>
<p>As you can see, two rows are returned from the query.</p>
<p>You can also use the keyword LIKE with the WHERE clause. This then replaces 
  the equals sign. LIKE is usually used with a wildcard character. The wildcard 
  character % means &quot;any characters&quot;, for example, while an underscore 
  is used for just a single character. </p>
<p>Instead of the equals sign or the keyword LIKE, you can also use the conditional 
  operators (Greater Than, Less Than, etc.). If we had a salary column, we could 
  search for all workers who are getting paid more than 1000 a week:</p>
<p align="center"><b>SELECT * FROM ADMIN.WORKERS WHERE SALARY &gt; 1000</b></p>
<p><br>
  <b>Exercise</b><br>
  Try running the following SQL Statement:</p>
<p align="center"><b>SELECT * FROM ADMIN.WORKERS WHERE JOB_TITLE LIKE '%er'</b></p>
<p>How many results are displayed?</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll leave SQL Statements there, as we now have enough to start programming. 
  Before doing so, however, close down the connection to your table by right clicking 
  it in the Services are. From the menu, select Disconnect:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/databases/table_disconnect.gif" width="364" height="265" alt="Disconnecting from your  Java DB database"></p>
<p>We'll connect to this database and table again, using Java code this time</p>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
